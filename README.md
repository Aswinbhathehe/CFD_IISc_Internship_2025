# CFD_IISc_Internship_2025
CFD codes from my time at IISc for solving Navier Strokes equation for incompressible fluid to validate shear and pressure driven flows conducted under Dr. Shubhdeep Mandal

Two pdfs are present in the main branch. 
'CFD Online Resources' are the resources given to me during the internship.
'Inertial bifurcation of the equilibrium position of a neutrally-buoyant circular cylinder in shear flow between parallel walls' by  Andrew J. Fox , James W. Schneider
 , and Aditya S. Khair is the research paper from which I had to confirm my results from.

 Also my internship report is attached in main branch
